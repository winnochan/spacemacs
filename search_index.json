This long history has given Emacs the ability to interact with almost every aspect of your digital life.\nSpacemacs is a community configuration providing a consistent and simple to learn approach to using all the features and power of Emacs.  Spacemacs also integrates the raw text manipulation speed of Vim and multi-modal editing into the Emacs experience, enabling you to be even more productive.\n\n\n\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 ShareAlike License (including images &amp; stylesheets).\n\nSpacemacs, Practicalli by John Stevenson is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.Based on a work at Spacemacs, Practicalli on Gitub.Permissions beyond the scope of this license may be available at @jr0cket.\n\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "},"repl-driven-development/":{"url":"repl-driven-development/","title":"REPL Driven Development","body":"REPL Driven Development\nClojure is a powerful, fun and highly productive language for developing applications and services.  The clear language design is supported by a powerful development environment known as the REPL (read, evaluate, print, loop).  The REPL gives you instant feedback on what your code does and enables you to test either a single expression or run the whole application (including tests).\nThe approach I take is called REPL driven development and I&apos;ll explain that here in detail.\nAlways running a REPL\nAs soon as I open a Clojure file I will start the REPL.  Coding without a REPL feels like tying my hands behind my back.  I want to get fast feedback from my code as I design it, testing my assumptions and design choices.\n\nEvaluating source code\nUse Clojure source code buffers to evaluate code and display the results inline.\n  Evaluate and Comment, e ; will evaluate the current form and print the result under the expression as a commentAdding results as comments is a great way to demonstrate the design of your code, especially in a journal.\nDesign Journal\nIt is highly recommended to journal your design process to make your code easier to understand and maintain.  Journals avoid the need for long hand-over or developer on-boarding processes as the journey through design decisions are already documented.\nIt is recommended to create a Design Journal section at the bottom of each namespace.  This journal should cover\n\nAll the important REPL experiments used to create the resulting namespace code.\nDiscussions of design choices, including those not taken and why.\nExpressions that can be evaluated to explain how a function or parts of a function works\n\nThe design journal can be used to create meaningful documentation for the project very easily and should prevent time spent on repeating exactly the same conversations.\n Add example journalDesign Journal for TicTacToe game using reagent, clojurescript and scalable vector graphics\nViewing data structures\nUse Pretty Print to view data structures that are the result of evaluating your code.  This makes those data structures easier to parse as a developer and more likely to notice incorrect results.\nCider Inspector is also a great way to navigate through a nested data structure.\n View large data sets, e P with open a new buffer with the results of the current function and so it very useful for larger data results.\nCode Style and idiomatic Clojure\n work in progress, sorry\nJoker for continuous Linting\nEastwood for Linting coverage\nKibit for idiomatic Clojure suggestions\nTest Driven Development and REPL Driven Development\nYou can use TDD and RDD together, there is a very natural merging of these approaches as they both encourage incremental changes and continuous feedback.  Test Driven Development also works well with Hammock Time, as you should spend more time thinking about what you want to do than typing code.  Tests provide an easy way to define and test your assumptions of your well considered design\nWith the power of the REPL, it is easy to get feedback on exactly how your code works.  Tests provide the codification of your evolving design and give you feedback when you break that design.\nAt some point before production you should have unit tests around the public API of each namespace in your project to catch regressions before committed.  It is much more efficient in terms of thinking time to create these tests as you stabilise the design that as an after thought.  So it makes sense to write these tests as part of the design process.\n Automate local test runnerSet up an automated test runner that will run on each file save\nContinuous Integration\n work in progress, sorry\nWire up a continuous integration server that runs tests and builds code on every shared commit (or every commit if you run a CI server locally).\nSpin up testable deployments of your application or service based on pre-defined branch commits or every commit if you do not share branches (i.e. push to shared master or develop branch), eg. Heroku Pipelines.\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "},"why-spacemacs/":{"url":"why-spacemacs/","title":"Why Spacemacs","body":"Why Spacemacs\nSpacemacs provides highly productive tooling for any software development, supporting numerous languages and common development tools.

So it only loads in those features you need.\nThe rest of this section goes into more details as to why you would choose Spacemacs for your developer life, including:\n\neasy to use configuration using layers (rather than configuring individual packages)\nClojure layer provides full CIDER &amp; clj-refactor support\n\n\nEasily discover commands with mnemonic menu\nHelm narrowing &amp; completion\nSimplifying keybindings with multiple states\nTransient State menus for repetitive actions\n\n\nStructured editing with Smartparens and Lisp mode\nFast project &amp; file management with Projectile, simple window &amp; buffer management too\n\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "},"why-spacemacs/extensive-language-support.html":{"url":"why-spacemacs/extensive-language-support.html","title":"Extensive Language Support","body":"Extensive Language Support\nAll the languages...\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n    \n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n    \n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n   \n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n   \n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\nAnd in the develop branch even more...\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "},"why-spacemacs/layers.html":{"url":"why-spacemacs/layers.html","title":"Simple Layers","body":"Simple Layers and Configuration\nMost language support and many other amazing features can be added to Emacs from many hundreds of packages created by the community. It does seem that there is a package for just about everything you want to do.\nSpacemacs uses Layers that organise these packages and the configuration to make them work seamlessly together.  For example, the Clojure layer is composed of 9 different packages that you would otherwise have to know about and install and then get them to work together with a bit of configuration code.  Layers make things very simple, requiring only one word to be added to the Spacemacs configuration file.\n\n HintSPC SPC butterfly to activate in Spacemacs.  Use this great power very carefully.\nSimple Configuration\nSpacemacs provides a well tested configuration file called ~/.spacemacs that provides lots of sensible defaults and makes customising your experience very easy.  This file is created during the Spacemacs installation.\nThe ~/.spacemacs configuration file is composed of three important sections\n\n\n\nSection\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\ndotspacemacs/layers\nLayers provide a simple way to add language support and tooling to Spacemacs.  A layer can contain elisp configuration and packages from Melpa/Elpa.  Individual Emacs packages can also be added (if they do not exist in any layer)\n\n\ndotspacemacs/init\nconfiguration applied when Spacemacs first starts, eg evil or holy mode(emacs), themes, fonts, full screen, recent files, etc\n\n\ndotspacemacs/user-config\nAdd your own customisation here\n\n\n\n Example .spacemacs configurationReview the authors current .spacemacs configuration file for examples of changes and the dotfile configuration section of the Spacemacs documentation for a complete overview.\nOpening and reloading the configuration file\nSpacemacs provides specific keybindings for opening and reloading the ~/.spacemacs configuration file.\n\n\n\nVim Normal\nEmacs\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nSPC f e d\nM-m f e d\nopen the ~/.spacemacs file\n\n\nSPC f e R\nM-m f e R\nreload the configuration from ~/.spacemacs\n\n\n\n Restart after changing configurationThe bigger a change you are making in the ~/.spacemacs configuration file, the more desirable it is to restart Emacs.  For example, if you are adding a large layer or multiple layers and pulling in a number of packages.\nUnless its a small change, then restart Emacs with SPC q r\nAdding a Layer\nSimply open the ~/.spacemacs file and add the name of the layer you want in the section dotspacemacs-configuration-layers.  Some layers also take additional configuration in the form of variables in the layer definition.\nSee the Spacemacs documentation for a list of layers or open the help in Spacemacs SPC h SPC to list all the layers, pressing RET on a layer name to read about it.\n\n  Notes for existing Emacs usersIf you have configured Emacs before, you can consider the .spacemacs file as a replacement for the init.el file you would otherwise use to define your Emacs configuration.Installing packages via the packages-list-packages method is ignored by Spacemacs.  Any packages installed in this way will be ignored.If no layer exists for a package, you can use a package without a layer.You can add what ever elisp you like to the dotspacemacs/user-config section of the ~/.spacemacs configuration file.\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "},"why-spacemacs/clojure-layer.html":{"url":"why-spacemacs/clojure-layer.html","title":"Clojure Layer","body":"Clojure Layer Overview\nThe Clojure layer provides and full language support and tooling including, autocomplete, refactor, inspector and debugger, etc.\nThis layer supports Clojure projects managed by Leiningen, Boot and Clojure CALI tools (deps.edn).\n\n CIDER is part of the Clojure layerThe Clojure layer is a collection of Emacs packages and curated configuration to ensure those packages work well together in Spacemacs.

Each state has a specific purpose, eg. normal mode is about manipulating existing text where insert state is about adding more text.\nUsing a state for different types of editing actions greatly simplifies the keyboard bindings and arguably makes editing faster, especially once you get used to multi-state editing.\nThis speed is in part due to simpler keybinding when in normal mode as you are not typing content into the editor, simply running commands with each key press.  This means you can have single characters to do many of the common commands, eg l instead of C-f for moving the cursor forward.\nIf you are deeply connected to the with Emacs keybindings, then probably best to stick to holy mode.\nIf you are new to Emacs or you just want to take advantage of Vim, then select Evil mode.\n Evil flagship - toggling between EmacsYou can toggle between any of the Vim states and the Emacs state with C-z.

It is very simple to navigate the structure of Clojure code by jumping from expression to expression.\nThis well defined structure also makes it trivial to move expressions around, giving you a simple way to develop and refactor your code.\n\n Structured Editing SectionRead the Structured editing section for a detailed guide to using Lisp mode, Smartparens, Paredit and Evil mode to manage your Clojure (and elsip) code.\nSmartparents For Writing Structured Text\nSpacemacs uses smartparens to help you write structured code really fast and also move expressions around.  Smartparens is a newer implementation of the classic paredit package.\n Evil-cleverparensEvil-cleverparens configures Vim states to respect smartparens rules. This ensures that you do not accidentally delete parenthesis and keeps the structure of your Clojure intact.See the section on Evil Clojure Editing.\nLisp State For Manipulating Structured Text\nSpacemacs includes lisp-state, SPC k . for refactoring Lisp base languages like Clojure.  In this lisp-state you can use the normal Vim keys to navigate your code by its structure.  You can also move symbols and expressions around without risking unmatched parenthesis or other structure characters (using slurp, barf, wrap, unwrap, etc.).\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "},"why-spacemacs/project-file-navigation.html":{"url":"why-spacemacs/project-file-navigation.html","title":"Project & File navigation","body":"Project and File Navigation\nProjectile provides easy project management and navigation.

Personally I use emacs-snapshot from this package archive which installs a recent snapshot of Emacs 27.\nMacOSX\nFor a self-contained install, download Emacs 26.3 or later from the Emacs for OSX website.\nAlternative, if you use Homebrew, run the following command:\nbrew cask install emacs\n\nWindows (version 7 or 10)\nDownload Emacs-26.3 from the GNU repository and extract the zip file to %AppData%/local/Programs/emacs.\nAlternatively, if you are using the Chocolatey package manager then install Emacs version 26\nAdd the Emacs directory to the PATH variable in your user account environment variables.\nTo start Emacs run the command runemacs.exe.  You can also pin this to the start menu or task bar.\n Access to common Unix toolsCommand line tools, such as diff, are used by Emacs.  To have these command line tools available in Windows, install Emacs as above but then run emacs from a Unix shell such as GitBash.\nMSYS2\nInstall Emacs (64bits build) with the following:\npacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-emacs\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "},"before-you-start/install-clojure.html":{"url":"before-you-start/install-clojure.html","title":"Install Clojure","body":"Install Clojure\n Install a Java runtime environment, preferably version 1.8 and Leiningen to create, manage and run Clojure projects.\nJava\n  Check you have a Java runtime on your system path by typing the following in a terminal window:\njava -version\n\nIf Java is not found, please install it from Oracle or OpenJDK.\nJava may also be available via your operating systems package manger, for example on Ubuntu / Debian systems this would be installed via:\nsudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jre\nLeiningen\nLeiningen is the most commonly used build automation tool used to manage Clojure projects.

Opening another frame gives you another instance of Emacs\n\n\nStatus\nInformation about current window and buffer, e.g. window number, buffer mode &amp; name, location of cursor\n\n\nMinibuffer\nA command line for Emacs - shows commands and some results\n\n\n\n\nWorking with Frames\nWhen you open Emacs for the first time you are presented with a frame that contains a single window.\nIf you run Emacs again, or if you make a new frame SPC w F, then a second frame will appear containing a single window.\nIf you kill a frame, only that frame closes unless it is the last Emacs frame running, then Emacs itself closes.\nIf you quit Emacs, then all frames are closed.\nWorking with windows\nThere can be one or more windows in Emacs.  Windows are used to split up the Emacs frame into sections.  This allows you to display multiple buffers (files, REPL, error messages, etc) at the same time.\nEach window has a number enabling you to jump between windows, e.g. SPC 1 takes you to window number 1.\nSome of the common windows functions include:\n\n\n\nkeybinding\naction\n\n\n\n\nSPC w\nOpens Window menu\n\n\nSPC w .\nOpen Window transient state menu for multiple command\n\n\nSPC w 2\n2 window layout - shows current buffer in new window\n\n\nSPC w 3\n3 window layout - shows current buffer in new windows\n\n\nSPC w m\nmaximise the current buffer\n\n\nSPC w d\ndelete current window\n\n\n\nGolden Ratio\nGolden-ratio automatically lays out windows in a Fibonacci style pattern.

For example:\n:!ls - run the ls command\n\nSpacemacs shell can be configured to pop-up a shell buffer to run commands from the directory of the current buffer.\n\nSpelling Checking\nAs you are typing in any(?) buffer then Spacemacs is checking your spelling as you type.  If you type a word that Spacemacs does not recognise then that word is underscored in red.  To correct a spelling:\n\nMove to the word that is incorrectly spelt\nSPC S c to change the word and show a list of suggested words\nEither type in a new spelling or use C-j and C-k keys to move down and back up the list of words, using RET to select that word.\n\nScrolling\nin evil command mode you can scroll just the text using the classic vi bindings.  This does not scroll the cursor unless the cursor hist the top or bottom of the window, in which case the cursor stays at that window boundry.\nC-y - scroll down\nC-e - scroll text up\njump around...\nSPC j i shows imenu that lists all the def and defn expressions in the current buffer, allowing you to jump to one of these definitions directly by typing its name or using C-j and C-k to select the name and pressing RET to jump to the name in the buffer\nSPC j l labels each line of the buffer with a short, unique character code.  By entering the character code you are taken directly to the specific line.  This is the avy goto line function and this works on all visible buffers by default, although it can be just shown on the current buffer (TODO: how is this set).\nsearching\nsearch with SPc /\nMatching only within a boundary by wrapping your search term with \\b.\nSo if you want to match or and not word, then you would do\nSPC / \\bor\\b\ngetting stuff done - evil basics\nhttp://paul-gowder.com/emacs.html\nchanging escape sequence for evil\n(setq evil-escape-key-sequence &quot;jk&quot;)\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "},"editing/vim-style/vim-tips-for-developers.html":{"url":"editing/vim-style/vim-tips-for-developers.html","title":"Vim Tips for developers","body":"Vim editing for Clojure developers\nVim keybindings that drive Vim editing tools that are common for developers\nComments and Commenting code\ng c c  comment line\nSPC ; ; comment current line\nSPC ; p comment current paragraph / code structure\nv (select) g c  comment region\ng c 9 j  comment 9 lines from current, downwards\nSPC v v g c  select line and comment it\nSimulated structural editing with surround\n\n\n\nKeybinding\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nv s ]\nsurround with [characters] without spaces\n\n\nv s [\nsurround with [ characters ] without spaces\n\n\nc s ( [\nchange surrounding from ( to [\n\n\nc i (\nchange in (\n\n\nc a (\nchange “around” (\n\n\n%\njump forwards to next paren, further % toggles between open and close parens.\n\n\nx p\ntranspose characters (cut current, paste after)\n\n\n\nmulti-replace with iedit and narrowing.\nSPC v select whatever you&#39;re at.

It is easy to move expressions around, pull code into expressions or push code out of expressions too.\n Add video of structural editing in practiceWatch Parens of the Dead to see live coding with structural editing\nSmartparens - writing structured text\nSpacemacs uses smart parens to help you write structured code really fast and also move expressions around.\nSPC SPC sp-cheet-sheet  lists all the smartparens commands available and we will cover the most common commands in this section.\n Smartparens is not just for lispsSmartparens is the default package that supports all languages in Spacemacs.  So as well as all lisp languages, it also support closing &amp; matching for things like tags in HTML.\nSmart parens is a newer implementation of the classic paredit package.\nLisp mode - manipulating structured text\nSpacemacs includes an Evil lisp-state, SPC k . for refactoring Lisp base languages like Clojure.  In this lisp-state you can use single character commands to move symbols and expressions around without risking unmatched parenthesis or other structure characters.\nThe lisp-state uses smartparens commands, so its a great way to learn structural editing.\nThe common commands I use are\n\n\n\nLisp state SPC k\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ns /  S\nslurp forwards / backwards - pull in code from the right / left\n\n\nb / B\nbarf forwards / backwards - push out code to the right / left\n\n\nd x\ndelete expression\n\n\nr\nraise expression - replace parent expression with current expression\n\n\n\n\nAlternatives: paredit and parinfer\nParedit was the original structural editing mode just for lisps, however, it is not actively maintained.  The Clojure layer in Spacemacs actually includes paredit, however no keybindings are defined, so you either have to use commands via SPC SPC or add your own keybindings to dotspacemacs/user-config, preferably using hooks on the Clojure mode.\nParinfer is relatively new and self describes as a bit of an experiment.  It does provide a bit more indentation automation which for some is great and for others quite confusing or annoying.  Smartparens and Clojure mode formatting does everything that Parinfer does, its just parinfer works a little differently and needs some configuration.\nEnable Vim support for Structural editing\nSafe Structural editing in Vim normal state respects structural editing too, meaning the standard vim commands can be used for cutting and deleting text without breaking Clojure or Lisp code structures.\nSafe structural editing is provided by the package evil-cleverparens which is included in the Clojure layer. By default this mode is not activated.\n\n\n\nSpacemacs\nVim\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nSPC m T s\n, T s\nEnable evil safe structural editing for the current buffer\n\n\n\nWhen enabled the symbol =&#x1F182;= is displayed in the mode-line.\n\nEnable for all =clojure= buffers by adding the following function in =dotspacemacs/user-config=\n(spacemacs/toggle-evil-safe-lisp-structural-editing-on-register-hook-clojure-mode)\n To enable evil safe structural editing for all supported modes:\n(spacemacs/toggle-evil-safe-lisp-structural-editing-on-register-hooks)\nBy adding clever-smartparens or evil-smartparens then Vim Normal state editing\n Move Vim alternatives to own sectionAlthough it is not structural editing, in Vim mode you can delete to a particular character.

I also use clj-refactor which takes care of adding require statements for me, so the require snippet is rarely used.\nDefault snippets for Clojure\nThe snippets that are available in Spacemacs can be found in the yasnippet github repository or in the ~/.emacs.d/elpa/yasnippet-20160501.1841/snippets/clojure-mode directory on your laptop (when yasnippet package is updated then name of that directory will change).\nAll the current snippets for Clojure mode are in the following table, indicating which tab stops they have.\n\n\n\nSnippet\nDescription\nTab Stops\n\n\n\n\nbench\nbenchmark an expression, using the time function\nbody\n\n\nbp\ndepreciated: break point in swank\n\n\n\ndef\ndef expression\nN/A\n\n\ndefm\ndefmacro expression, with name, doc-string, arguments &amp; body tabstops\nname, docstring, args, body\n\n\ndefn\ndefn expression, with name, doc-string, arguments &amp; body tabstops\nname, docstring, args, body\n\n\ndefr\ndefrecord\ndocstring, object, args, body\n\n\ndeft\ndeftype\ndocstring, object, args, body\n\n\ndoseq\ndoseq\nname, body\n\n\nfn\nfn - anonymous function\nname, body\n\n\nfor\nfor\ncondition, body\n\n\nif\nif\ncondition, body\n\n\nifl\nif-let - if true, bind a local name\nbinding, body\n\n\nimport\nimport java library\nlibrary name\n\n\nis\nis - clojure test assertion\nvalue, expected\n\n\nlet\nlet - bind a local name to a value\nname, value, body\n\n\nmap\nmap\nfn, col, col\n\n\nmap.lambda\nmap with anonymous function #()\nfn, body\n\n\nmdoc\nmetadata docstring\ndocstring\n\n\nns\nns - expression with the current namespace inserted automatically\nN/A\n\n\nopts\ndestructuring a map with :keys, :or for default values, :as for entire vector\n:key binding, or defaults, :as binding\n\n\npr\nprn - print function\nstring/value\n\n\nprint\nprintln - print function\nstring/value\n\n\nreduce\nreduce - reduce expression with an anonymous function\nargs, body\n\n\nrequire\n:require expression with library and alias\nlibrary, alias\n\n\ntest\ndeftest expression\ntest description, value/expected\n\n\ntry\ntry &amp; catch expression\ntry expression, exception name, body\n\n\nuse\ndepreciated: use require instead\n\n\n\nwhen\nwhen\nwhen expression, body\n\n\nwhenl\nwhen-let - local binding on when condition\nbinding, body\n\n\n\n  Writing org-mode tables in markdownThe above table was created in Emacs markdown mode by enabling the minor mode: orgtbl-mode.  Start the table with a | character followed by a word and use TAB to create and align the table as you go through.  If you already have content, use the function orgtbl-create-or-convert-from-region.  To enable orgtbl-mode by default when in markdown major mode, edit your ~/.spacemacs file, in the dotspacemacs/user section add the line (add-hook &apos;markdown-mode-hook &apos;turn-on-orgtbl).\nHope you have fun speeding up the writing of your Clojure code (and any other common text) in Spacemacs / Emacs.\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "},"snippets/add-your-own-snippets.html":{"url":"snippets/add-your-own-snippets.html","title":"Add your own Snippets","body":"Add your own Snippets\nSpacemacs has lots of snippets for most of the languages and modes it supports.  However, YASnippets also uses a simple template system in plain text, so its pretty easy to learn.  Lets look at how to add your own snippets with Spacemacs.\nautomatically create snippets\nSelect a code block that you often create and using the yasnippets tools to create your own generic template\n\nPress v for visual mode and move the cursor around to select the text, or SPC v to grow the selected region\nSPC SPC helm-yas-create-snippet-on-region creates a new snippet\nEnter the name you wish to refer to this snippet\nSelect the major mode you want to add the snippet too (eg. clojure, markdown, html)\nEdit the text and delete any text that is not required\nAdd tab points in the snippet if relevant\n$1 initial cursor position, $2 next cursor position on tab, $0 end cursor position.\n\n\nSPC SPC yas-tryout-snippet to test the snippet has the right behaviour\nSPC SPC yas-load-snippet-buffer to load the snippet into the defined mode\n\nManually adding snippets\nThe easiest place to add your own snippet definitions is in the ~/.emacs.d/private/snippets directory.  Under this directory structure you should create a folder named after the relevant mode for your snippets, eg markdown-mode.  Inside this mode folder, create files whos names are based on the snippet alias you wish.\nSo for a work in progress snipped called wip in markdown mode I created ~/.emacs.d/private/snippets/markdown-mode/wip file.\nYou need to load this new snippet into Spacemacs by either restarting or using the command M-x yas-load-snippet-buffer command in the buffer of the new snippet you have just written.  Ths snippet with then work within any markdown mode buffer.\nManaging your snippets\nAlthough the private snippets directory is easy to use, it is not under version control.  So although its not over-riddend by Spacemacs it also means your private snippets are not backed up anywhere.\nIf you use the ~/.spacemacs.d/snippets/modename-mode/ directory structure for your snippets then you can version them with Git or similar versioning tools.\nHow to write a snippet\nEach snippet template is contained in its own file, named after the alias of the snippet.  So a snippet called wip will be in a filename wip, in a directory named after the relevant Emacs mode.\nThe basic structure of a snippet template is:\n#name : FullNameOfSnippet (not the alias name, the full name shows in autocompletion menu)\n#contributor: John Stevenson &lt;john@jr0cket.co.uk&gt;\n# --\nAdd the content you want to replace the snippet name with when it expands\nThe content can be anything, simple text or more usefully a code strucuture with placeholders\nExample: Simple text replacement\nI use markdown mode for writing a lot of content, especially for technical workshops.  As I am developing these workshops its useful to highlight which sections are still work in progress.  Rather than type the common message I use, I&#39;ve created a simple snippet called wip.\n#name : WorkInProgress\n#contributor: John Stevenson &lt;john@jr0cket.co.uk&gt;\n# --\n&gt; **Fixme** work in progress\nWhen you expand this snippet with M-/ then the snippet name is replaced by the content.\nExample: Using tab stops\nLets look at an existing snippet called form in the html-mode.  This expands into a html form, but also helps you jump from method, id, action and content.\n#contributor : Jimmy Wu &lt;frozenthrone88@gmail.com&gt;\n#name :&lt;form method=&quot;...&quot; id=&quot;...&quot; action=&quot;...&quot;&gt;&lt;/form&gt;\n# --\n&lt;form method=&quot;$1&quot; id=&quot;$2&quot; action=&quot;$3&quot;&gt;\n  $0\n&lt;/form&gt;\nThis snippet is the same as the simpler example, except we have added tab stops using the $ sign and a number.  When you expand this snippet, the snippet name is replaced by the content as usual but the cursor is placed at the first tab stop $1.  Each time you press TAB you move to the next tab stop.\n$0 is our exit point from the snippet, so pressing TAB reverts to the usual behaviour outside of YASnippet.\nFor more examples talk a look at the Emacs YASnippet video tutorial or the blogs: Adding YASnippets snippets &amp; Snippet expansion with YASnippet\nTesting your snippets\nOnce you have written your snippet, you can quickly test it using M-x yas-tryout-snippet.  This opens a new empty buffer in the appropriate major mode and inserts the snippet so you can then test it with M-/.\nIf you just want to try the snippet in an existing buffer, then use M-x yas-load-snippet-buffer to load this new snippet into the correct mode.  M-x yas-load-snippet-buffer does exactly the same except it kills the snippet buffer (prompting to save first if neccessary).\n\nThere are no default keybindings for these commands in Spacemacs, so you could create a binding under C-o, for example C-o C-s t to try a snippet and C-o C-s l to load a snippet.\n\nAdding yas-snippets to autocompletion in Spacemacs\nBy adding the autocompletion layer in Spacemacs the YASnippets can be shown in the autocompletion menu as you type.\nBy default, snippets are not shown in the auto-completion popup, so set the variable auto-completion-enable-snippets-in-popup to t.\n(setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers\n              &#39;((auto-completion :variables\n                                 auto-completion-enable-snippets-in-popup t)))\n\nSummary\nFind out more about YASnippets and autocompletion from the Github repository for Spacemacs autocompletion layer.

It should be bound to a\nfunction that takes the current namespace and returns the matching test\nnamespace (which may be the same as the current namespace).\n\nIf your individual tests are not defined by deftest or defspec, CIDER will\nnot recognize them when searching for a test at point in cider-test-run-test.\nYou can customize the variable cider-test-defining-forms to add additional\nforms for CIDER to recognize as individual test definitions.\n\nIf you want to view the test report regardless of whether the tests have\npassed or failed:\n\n\n(setq cider-test-show-report-on-success t)\n\nRunning tests automatically (test-driven development)\nCIDER provides a minor-mode that automatically runs all tests for a namespace\nwhenever you load a file (with C-c C-k).

Also, as described above before, CIDER is smart\nenough to figure out the namespace containing the tests.\nUsing cider-test with alternative test libraries\nThe clojure.test machinery is designed to be pluggable. Any test library\ncan implement it if so desired, and therefore leverage cider-test. For\ninstance, test.check does this, and\ncider-test handles defspec just like deftest.\nAs a test framework author, supporting the built-in clojure.test machinery\n(and hence cider-test) is pretty straightforward:\n\nAssoc each test fn as :test metadata on some var. These are what get run.\nImplement the clojure.test/report multimethod to capture the test results.\n\nThe test.check library is a good example here.

Type r to show the rebase popup. Then type m to invoke the &quot;edit a commit&quot; rebase variant. A buffer with recent commits appears. Move to the commit you want to modify and type C-c C-c to select it. Git then rewinds history to that commit and shows information about the ongoing rebase in the status buffer.\nModify HEAD using the amend tools\nr r to confirm the changes are complete.\nIf A&apos; and B conflict then rebase will stop at B and you have to resolve the conflict. After you have done so press r r to continue.\nIf you know that your changes to A will result in conflicts with B, then proceed as describe above, otherwise use the following approach.\nGit allows creating &quot;fixup commits&quot; using git commit --fixup A. This creates a new commit, which records changes which &quot;should have been made in another commit&quot;. That commit becomes the new HEAD. There also exists a --squash variant. For information about the differences see the git-commit man page.\nrebase with autosquash\nTo actually combine the A commit and the new commit A&apos; and then reapply B on top of that you have to use rebase. Magit provides a convenient command for doing so on r f.\nThe main difference to the above approach is that here we first create a new commit and then we rebase to combine that with the &quot;target&quot; and reapply B. Above we began with rebasing instead of committing.\nIn Magit both the --fixup and the --squash variants are available from the commit popup, on f and s. But Magit also provides &quot;instant&quot; variants of the fixup and squash commands on F and S. These variants create a new commit like the &quot;non-instant&quot; variants, but then they instantly combine the fixup commit with the target commit using rebase, without you having to invoke another command.\n&quot;Instant fixup&quot; (c F) is essentially the same thing as &quot;extend HEAD&quot; (c e), except that it works for any commit, not just HEAD.\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "},"magit/reset-commit-history.html":{"url":"magit/reset-commit-history.html","title":"Reset Commits","body":"Reset Commit History\nReset allows you to roll back commit history.

I will remove the token from .gitconfig and test.\nThe following section needs updating.\nWhen you first run any of the Gist or Github commands you will be prompted for your username, password and 2Factor code.\nEntering correct account details will create a personal access token on your Github account.  This personal access token is also copied to your local Git config, ~/.gitconfig, avoiding the need to prompt for your Github login details each time.\n Managing your personal access tokenIf you are prompted to enter your personal access token in Emacs, then visit your Github profile page and view the personal acccess tokens section.  Edit the token named git.el and regenerated the token.  This will take you back to the personal access tokens page and display the new token for git.el.  Copy this token into the [github] section of your ~/.gitconfig as follows[github]\n    user = jr0cket\n    oauth-token = thisishweretherealtokenshouldbepasted\nIf git.el adds a password line to the [github] section of your ~/.gitconfig you should remove that password line.

So if you make changes to your buffer you want to share, you can generate a new gist using M-x gist-buffer &amp; delete the original one (see listing &amp; managing gists below).\nAlternatively, once you have created a Gist, you can open that Gist in a buffer and make changes.  When you save your changes in the Gist buffer, C-x C-s, the gist on gist.github.com is updated.\nListing &amp; managing Gists\nUse the command M-x gist-list or keybinding M-m g g l to show a list of your current Gists.\n\nIn the buffer containing the list of your gists, you can use the following commands in Emacs mode.\n\nRETURN : opens the gist in a new buffer\ng : reload the gist list from server\ne : edit the gist description, so you know what this gist is about\nk : delete current gist\nb : opens the gist in the current web browser\ny : show current gist url &amp; copies it into the clipboard\n* : star gist (stars do not show in gist list, only when browsing them on github)\n^ : unstar gist\nf : fork gist - create a copy of your gist on gist.github.com\n+ : add a file to the current gist, creating an additional snippet on the gist\n- : remove a file from the current gist\n\nThe Spacemacs Github layer adds the following key bindings for Vim\n\n\n\nNormal\nDescription\nCommand\n\n\n\n\nf\nopen gist in another buffer\ngist-fetch-current\n\n\nK\ndelete current gist\ngist-kill-current\n\n\no\nopen gist in your web browser\ngist-browse-current-url\n\n\n\nCreating Gists from files with dird\nIf you open a dired buffer you can make gists from marked files, m, by pressing @.

How to jump to a line number or jump the cursor a number of lines\nManipulating case of text\nCase Conversion Commands\nEmacs has commands for converting either a single word or any arbitrary range of text to upper case or to lower case.\nM-l\nConvert following word to lower case (downcase-word).\nM-u\nConvert following word to upper case (upcase-word).\nM-c\nCapitalize the following word (capitalize-word).\nC-x C-l\nConvert region to lower case (downcase-region).\nC-x C-u\nConvert region to upper case (upcase-region).\nM-l (downcase-word) converts the word after point to lower case, moving past it. Thus, repeating M-l converts successive words. M-u (upcase-word) converts to all capitals instead, while M-c (capitalize-word) puts the first letter of the word into upper case and the rest into lower case. All these commands convert several words at once if given an argument. They are especially convenient for converting a large amount of text from all upper case to mixed case, because you can move through the text using M-l, M-u or M-c on each word as appropriate, occasionally using M-f instead to skip a word.\nWhen given a negative argument, the word case conversion commands apply to the appropriate number of words before point, but do not move point. This is convenient when you have just typed a word in the wrong case: you can give the case conversion command and continue typing.\nIf a word case conversion command is given in the middle of a word, it applies only to the part of the word which follows point. (This is comparable to what M-d (kill-word) does.) With a negative argument, case conversion applies only to the part of the word before point.\nThe other case conversion commands are C-x C-u (upcase-region) and C-x C-l (downcase-region), which convert everything between point and mark to the specified case. Point and mark do not move.\nThe region case conversion commands upcase-region and downcase-region are normally disabled. This means that they ask for confirmation if you try to use them. When you confirm, you may enable the command, which means it will not ask for confirmation again. See Disabling.\nc\nTerminology\nFunctions\nFunction refers to the thing that you are calling when you hit a key or series of keys. For example j in normal modeis mapped to the function evil-next-line. In elisp these usually look like strings of hyphenated words. spc spc opens helm M-x and lets you search for functions by name and execute them. Note that functions may also be refered to as sexps (symbolic expressions).\nBuffers\nBuffers are like tabs in your browser. You open them from files on your computer instead of from the internet, and they stay open until you close them. Hit spc b b to see a searchable list of your open buffers, and recently opened buffers. spc b B opens a list of buffers organized by major mode. spc b d deletes the buffer you are currently in. As you can most the spc b commands are related to buffers. But buffers arent necessarily just files you open, they can also be generated by emacs (like the helm mini buffer (spc b b) you use to search buffers) to do useful things.\nThe Mode Line\nAt the bottom of the window, you will see the mode line. Its got some handy information in it. From left to right it shows you:\nYour window number. The color indicates what evil mode you are in (normal, insert, etc)\nA little * indicator if your file has been modified since it has been saved.\nBuffer size.\nBuffer name (same as file name if you have opened from file).\nMajor mode.\nMinor modes.\nOn the far right is info about where you are in a buffer. Move around whth hjkl and watch it if you dont get it at first.\nMajor Modes\nThis is how emacs organizes important sets of functionality. Each buffer will have one major mode at a time. It can customize anything about emacs so that it suits the buffer you are working with. There is a mode for editing C#, a mode for editing latex, a mode for viewing files (dired-mode), a mode for searching (helm-major-mode), a mode for emulating a terminal (term-mode). You can see what major mode you are in at the bottom of each buffer in your mode line. Usually this is automatically set depending on which buffer you are in. Major modes specific functions are on the , key (also spc m).\nMinor Modes\nMinor modes are smaller sets of custom behavior that can work together. A major mode will automatically set a bunch of relevant minor modes, but you can toggle them with spc t. For example spc t n toggles a minor mode for line numbers. You can hover over the symbols in the modeline with your mouse to see what minor mode each represents. spc h d m (help describe mode) opens a comprehensive list of your active minor modes. Move your cursor to one and hit enter to get more information.\nSide Note: The information opens in a split buffer titled help. Many of these buffers that are meant to be temporary can be closed quickly with q.\nLayers\nEverything so far (except specific key bindings) applies to emacs in general. Layers, however, are a spacemacs specific term. Layers are meant to be a simple way for you to customize your configuration by adding only one line to your .spacemacs file. See the list to see what are available. Check out the latex layer for example.\nThe .spacemacs file\nHit spc f e d (file emacs dotfile) to open this file. This is where you can customize everything. Find the dotspacemacs-configuration-layers line. You can use / in normal mode to start searching for it and enter when you have it. Add latex in that list. It should look like this:\ndotspacemacs-configuration-layers &#39;(\n  latex\n  other-layer\n  other-layer)\nNow spacemacs will load that layer on startup for you, which includes a major mode for editing latex and a bunch of commands. You can now either restart emacs, or hit spc f e R(file emacs reload) to reload your config. Now if you hit spc f f (file find) and open a latex file you should have some syntax highlighting and latex specific commands on your , key.\nWhy Vim ?\nPositives\n\nCut the Mouse - One of the main wins for Vim has always been that it is an editor that lets you keep your hands on the keyboard. Reaching for the mouse slows you down, and while I never really had a problem with that in the past (I spend more time thinking and reading than I do writing code), now that I’ve experienced 2 months with my hands on the keyboard I do find myself noticing (annoyingly) when I am forced to reach for the mouse.\n\nFast Navigation - Moving around inside files in most windows editors involves a lot of home/end/up/down arrow key. Having search and tag based navigation makes getting around within a file much faster. Finding the right file is also easier with the commandt plugin, influenced by Textmate on the Mac, this fuzzy file finder is not typically available in traditional windows editors (last time I looked)\n\nSplit Windows - Splitting windows into panes and navigating around them is a killer feature that I use all the time to see multiple files at once, or multiple areas of the same file at once. In the past I used tabs heavily, but I now prefer split panes that I can manage without reaching for the mouse.\n\n\nNegatives\nHJKL - Sorry, call me a heretic but I just cannot get used to using these keys for up/down/left/right. 20+ years of using the arrow keys is completely and utterly embedded in my brain. Besides, I’m pretty sure J (down) and K (up) are bass-ackwards. Western languages, and presumably most programming languages, read from TOP LEFT to BOTTOM RIGHT so shouldn’t UP be next to LEFT and DOWN be next to RIGHT ??? I know I could remap the keys, but plugins that follow similar patterns would also have to be remapped and I just could not get used to it.\n\nMode Struggles - The modal nature of Vim is both a blessing and a curse. Its the feature that allows us to keep our hands on the keyboards without the wrist breaking key combo’s of Emacs but its also far too easy to forget which mode you are in and start typing code only to discover you just executed 5 random commands. The people who recommend you ESC constantly back into command mode are absolutely correct. You have to shift your thinking into being primarily command based with short sharp bursts of INSERT.\n\nBreaking Windows - One of the side effects of the modal nature of vim is that it trains you to constantly hit ESCAPE to go back to command mode…. but when you do this in more traditional windows apps its quite possible you will end up dismissing a dialog while you are in the middle of typing! How frustrating! I hit this mostly when using Tortoise SVN for my code commits.\n\nDisappointing Plugins - Whilst some plugins are awesome, some are surprisingly disappointing. While I was really looking forward to them, the following plugins just didn’t get as much use as I expected session (doesn’t work well with NERDTree or quickfix window), taglist (doesn’t work well with dynamic languages - at the moment I use primarily Ruby and Javascript), Conque Shell - (nice idea, but doesn’t feel natural, just easier to use :shell or have another terminal open)\nEffort vs Reward\nOk. So I have a theory…\nVim proponents will tell you that the effort you spend learning vim will pay dividends in the long run once you know how to use it properly. After 60 days I can say that I agree with that opinion.\nHowever, if I spent this much effort learning any editor I think it would pay dividends in the long run. The difference is that Vim forces you to go through this pain, whilst other editors work ‘out the box’ and so most programmers are not inclined to learn the power of those editors.\nFor example, I think UltraEdit, TextMate, even Visual Studio are pretty good editors, but since they all pretty much just work out of the box, its easy to ignore their advanced features and not spend the time customizing and configuring them.\nI wonder if I spent 60 days really learning UltraEdit if I couldn’t get the same positives I described here ? Hmmm, a future article maybe?\nConclusion\nI’m still using Vim after 60 days, and I plan to continue using it for the foreseeable future as long as I can keep taking a little time here and there to dig deeper, customize a bit more, learn how to overcome the negatives and build upon the positives.\nVim seems to be so powerful that I could be learning it forever. Here’s a list of some of the things I want to spend time on in the future.\nMovement - I need to learn more code related movement commands like % match\nSessions - Both sessions.vim and sessionman.vim seem to struggle with NERDTree and the quickfix window\nCut &amp; Paste - I need to learn more about vim registers so I can manage my cut &amp; paste better, errr, sorry, I mean yank &amp; put\nUndo &amp; Redo - I think I spend too much time in insert mode so when I undo it tends to be more than I’d like\nHJKL - Maybe I should remap to swap the J and K keys and try again!\nMore Plugins - There are many more plugins I would like to take the time to check out, and perhaps build some of my own.\nprojectile\nSPC p p - switch to another project that spacemacs knows about\nranger\nA fast way to browse files and directories\nuse vim keybindings to navigate\nj / k -- up / down current directory\nl -- into the currently selected directory\nh -- up to parent directory\nq -- quit\nsome configuration to consider\n (ranger :variables\n         ranger-ignored-extensions &#39;(\n                                     &quot;mkv&quot; &quot;iso&quot; &quot;mp4&quot; &quot;avi&quot; &quot;mp4&quot; &quot;mkv&quot;\n                                     &quot;zip&quot; &quot;rar&quot; &quot;exe&quot; &quot;ps&quot; &quot;webm&quot; &quot;png&quot;\n                                     &quot;jpg&quot; &quot;jpeg&quot; &quot;tif&quot; &quot;tiff&quot; &quot;ics&quot; &quot;dmg&quot;\n                                     &quot;swf&quot; &quot;gz&quot; &quot;m4a&quot;)\n         ranger-max-preview-size 4  ;; Megabyte\n         ranger-cleanup-eagerly t\n         )\niedit-mode\nSPC s e\n\nBlog: http://nexusstar.name/hackpads/spacemacs-iedit-mode-cheat-sheat/\n\niedit-mode (aka interactive-edit-mode) gives you the power to edit instances of the same text string in a buffer. It’s quite similar to multiple cursors, although if you’re used to working with multiple cursors, it’s likely you’ll prefer that.\nIEdit defaults to selecting all matches, and then allows you to reduce and expand the matches in various ways, so the workflow is in the opposite direction.\nI use iedit often as a quick interactive replace all, and multiple cursors for anything in between that and more complicated regexp search replace.\nIn conjunction with wgrep-mode (that is a writeable grep mode, which works with most grep alternative tools as well) iedit-mode can become a poweful way to edit a string across many files and review the changes before you save them.\nTo install it use M-x package-install iedit\nOnce installed you can start it with C-; (M-x iedit-mode)\nNote, this doesn’t work in a terminal so in that case I’d bind it to C-c ;\nSpacemacs has a binding for IEdit mode on it’s SPACE leader (SPC s e)\nMultiple cursor options in spacemacs\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/spacemacs/comments/4641zt/how_the_heck_do_i_use_multicursor_support/\ngeneral stuff\nFrom: http://blog.christopher-atkins.com/more-spacemacs\nInter-file Navigation SPC b b open Helm mini-buffer SPC f f Helm find files, is less useful than SPC p f Projectile find files SPC p p Projectile find project\nUsing the Ranger layer (file manager) invoked using SPC a r (applications ranger) Consier using Unimpaired layer (tpope quick cycling) Consider using Fasd layer to complement Fasd\nIntra-file Navigation SPC s s SWOOP! opens a copy of the buffer then elides lines that don’t match the search you type, allowing you to navigate the top buffer by selecting lines in the swoop buffer\nWindow navigation SPC  navigate numbered windows Eyebrowse layer allows SPC W then a number to create/navigate to a new workspace with Eybrwose working you can using Vim’s gt and gT to\nEditing Select some text, then s  will surround with  iedit, get a selection (the whole current symbol by default) then SPC s e to enter iedit mode, allowing you to edit all the matched things at once SPC ; ; toggle line comment Diacritics in Emacs C-x 8 &#39; e to creates é\nHelp SPC h d invokes “help describe”, providing access to multipe ways of find help SPC f e h is canonical spacemacs help\nChecking SPC t s turns on syntax checking\nFuture layers to explore OrgMode + Capture mode Abbrev mode\nEditorconfig layer to manage things like indent and such\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "},"spacemacs-basics/emacs-quick-reference.html":{"url":"spacemacs-basics/emacs-quick-reference.html","title":"Emacs Quick Reference","body":"Emacs Quick Reference\n Consider moving this to just a reference section.
